#Configuration file for generating a MATSim pre-base scenario
#The parameters below can be edited according to one's needs.
#The variables' names however should not be edited in order not to break the scenario generation process.
#I'm trying to make as many variables as possible fixed to keep the configurable part small. /dhosse
#Especially basic input data (e.g. MiD, admin borders, osm) should be non-configurable.


#The id(s) of the survey area(s)
#If unknown, look into table gadm.districts
#seperate multiple entries with commas
surveyAreaIds	09180
#TODO: vicinity of survey area


#The coordinate system used (automatically by selecting a survey area? In most cases UTM32N and UTM33N will be used) /dhosse
#Input data must have the projection EPSG:4326!
coordinateSystem	EPSG:32632


#Output directory (where the output files are written to) /dhosse
outputDirectory	/home/dhosse/dessau/foo/


#The type of population you want to create. Possible values are "dummy","commuter","complete"
#dummy: some randomly distributed population of any size (for playing around)
#commuter: only commuters with home-work-home trips (that may be sufficient for some use-cases)
#complete: plan creation with integration of mobility survey data, commuter data etc.
populationType	complete

#The scale factor for the population (number of persons) and network capacities
#Any numeric value larger than 0 and less or equal 1
scaleFactor	1


#The public transport part
