#Configuration file for generating a MATSim pre-base scenario
#The parameters below can be edited according to one's needs.
#The variables' names however should not be edited in order not to break the scenario generation process.

#I'm trying to make as many variables as possible fixed to keep the configurable part small. /dhosse

#The file that contains the osm data (in database?) /dhosse
osmFile	""

#The id(s) of the survey area(s)
surveyAreaIds	""

#The coordinate system used (automatically by selecting a survey area? In most cases UTM32N and UTM33N will be used) /dhosse
coordinateSystem	EPSG:32632

#Working directory (where the input and output files should be located) /dhosse
workingDirectory	""

#commuters (n database?) /dhosse
inputCommuterFile	""

#reverse commuters (in database?) /dhosse
inputReverseCommuterFile	""

#The type of population you want to create. Possible values are "dummy","commuter","complete"
#dummy: some randomly distributed population of any size (for playing around)
#commuter: only commuters with home-work-home trips (that may be sufficient for some use-cases)
#complete: plan creation with integration of mobility survey data, commuter data etc.
populationType	complete

#This part refers to the MiD database
#Must not be edited unless you know what you're doing!
#It would be enough to keep the last three parameters in here, I'm only having a problem with commiting our database password into a public repo (MATSim)... /dhosse
