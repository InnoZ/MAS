#Configuration file for generating a MATSim pre-base scenario
#The parameters below can be edited according to one's needs.
#The variables' names however should not be edited in order not to break the scenario generation process.

#I'm trying to make as many variables as possible fixed to keep the configurable part small. /dhosse
#Especially basic input data (e.g. MiD, admin borders, osm) should be non-configurable.


#The id(s) of the survey area(s)
surveyAreaIds	""


#The coordinate system used (automatically by selecting a survey area? In most cases UTM32N and UTM33N will be used) /dhosse
#Input data must have the projection EPSG:4326!
coordinateSystem	EPSG:32632


#Working directory (where the input and output files should be located) /dhosse
workingDirectory	""


#Commuter files should definitely be inside a database somewhere / dhosse
#commuters (n database?) /dhosse
inputCommuterFile	""


#reverse commuters (in database?) /dhosse
inputReverseCommuterFile	""


#The type of population you want to create. Possible values are "dummy","commuter","complete"
#dummy: some randomly distributed population of any size (for playing around)
#commuter: only commuters with home-work-home trips (that may be sufficient for some use-cases)
#complete: plan creation with integration of mobility survey data, commuter data etc.
populationType	complete


#This part refers to the MiD database
#Edit only if you know what you're doing!
#It would be enough to keep the last three parameters in here, I'm only having a problem with committing a database password into a public repo (MATSim)... /dhosse
databaseUser	postgres
password	postgres
#The query could be automated by selected the bbsr district type directly from geodata. //dhosse
midQuery	select * from mid2008.persons_raw where bland=3 and rtypd7=3
useHouseholds	true
onlyWorkingDays	true
