#Configuration file for generating a MATSim pre-base scenario
#The parameters below can be edited according to one's needs.
#The variables' names however should not be edited in order not to break the scenario generation process.

#I'm trying to make as many variables as possible fixed to keep the configurable part small. /dhosse
#Especially basic input data (e.g. MiD, admin borders, osm) should be non-configurable.


#The id(s) of the survey area(s)
surveyAreaIds	9180


#The coordinate system used (automatically by selecting a survey area? In most cases UTM32N and UTM33N will be used) /dhosse
#Input data must have the projection EPSG:4326!
coordinateSystem	EPSG:32632


#Working directory (where the input and output files should be located) /dhosse
workingDirectory	/home/dhosse/


#The type of population you want to create. Possible values are "dummy","commuter","complete"
#dummy: some randomly distributed population of any size (for playing around)
#commuter: only commuters with home-work-home trips (that may be sufficient for some use-cases)
#complete: plan creation with integration of mobility survey data, commuter data etc.
populationType	complete

#The scale factor for the population and network capacities
#Any numeric value larger than 0 and less or equal 1
scaleFactor	1


#Defines if buildings should be used as activity locations.
#Default is false (= use landuse data only)
useBuildings	false


#The public transport part
createTransit	false

#This part refers to the MiD database
#Edit only if you know what you're doing!
#It would be enough to keep the last three parameters in here, I'm only having a problem with committing a database password into a public repo (MATSim)... /dhosse
databaseUser	postgres
password	postgres
#The query could be automated by selected the bbsr district type directly from geodata. //dhosse
midQuery	select * from households_raw where bland=9 and rtypd7=7
useHouseholds	true
#optional: use vehicle data from mid to model non-generic vehicles for households (useHouseholds has to be set to "true")
useVehicles	false
onlyWorkingDays	true
